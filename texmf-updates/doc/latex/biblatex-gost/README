These are Biblatex bibliography and citation styles to format bibliography according to Russian standard GOST 7.0.5-2008. The documentation provided is mainly in Russian, since anyone wishing to use GOST styles can supposedly write, and of course read Russian. The translation may follow, though.

To install just unzip the package into your texmf tree (preferably local) and update the TeX hash (for example, in TeX Live run texhash).
